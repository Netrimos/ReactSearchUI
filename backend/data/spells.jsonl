While miniaturized, the creature is under an effect similar to that of a flesh to stone spell: It is mindless and inert, and does not seem alive when viewed with spells like deathwatch . However, you may return the creature to its normal form at any time simply by placing the figurine on the ground, touching it, and uttering a word of command. Otherwise, the creature remains in miniature form unless the spell is broken, such as by dispel magic or stronger magic. Unlike a flesh to stone spell, a creature affected by carry companion is unaffected by stone to flesh . If the miniature figurine is broken or damaged, the creature (if returned to its original state) has similar damage or deformities.

When you call a creature using planar inquiry, the only task that you can ask of the creature is for it to answer questions or gather information regarding a specific topic (a person, a place, or a thing). After hearing your request, if the creature has an appropriate Knowledge skill, it can attempt a check to provide the information it has. If it lacks such a skill, the called creature leaves for 1d4 hours to gather this information. Upon its return, you roll 1d20 + your caster level , and use the result to determine what information the creature has gathered about the subject (as if using Diplomacy ). The called creature stays for up to 10 minutes as it relays this information to you, after which it departs to its home plane. If the creature is attacked or damaged at any time during the spell’s duration, the spell ends and the creature returns to the plane from which you summoned it. When you cast this spell, you can choose a specific kind of outsider to call, even calling an individual creature by name. The kind of outsider called doesn’t alter the effects of the spell, but when you use planar inquiry to summon a creature with an alignment or elemental subtype, the spell gains that descriptor. You cannot call an outsider whose Hit Dice exceed your caster level (maximum 18 HD) and you cannot use this spell to contact a unique outsider (such as a deity’s herald) or an outsider with mythic ranks.

When you call a creature using planar inquiry, the only task that you can ask of the creature is for it to answer questions or gather information regarding a specific topic (a person, a place, or a thing). After hearing your request, if the creature has an appropriate Knowledge skill, it can attempt a check to provide the information it has. If it lacks such a skill, the called creature leaves for 1d4 hours to gather this information. Upon its return, you roll 1d20 + your caster level , and use the result to determine what information the creature has gathered about the subject (as if using Diplomacy ). The called creature stays for up to 10 minutes as it relays this information to you, after which it departs to its home plane. If the creature is attacked or damaged at any time during the spell’s duration, the spell ends and the creature returns to the plane from which you summoned it. When you cast this spell, you can choose a specific kind of outsider to call, even calling an individual creature by name. The kind of outsider called doesn’t alter the effects of the spell, but when you use planar inquiry to summon a creature with an alignment or elemental subtype, the spell gains that descriptor. You cannot call an outsider whose Hit Dice exceed your caster level (maximum 18 HD) and you cannot use this spell to contact a unique outsider (such as a deity’s herald) or an outsider with mythic ranks.
